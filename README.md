Centralized Communication for Modern Pharmacies
Pill Connect is a unified messaging and management platform designed to streamline communication across the pharmacy ecosystem. It enables pharmacies to securely message patients, collaborate with doctors and hospitals, and manage prescriptions—all from a single interface.

The platform supports broadcast messaging, prescription visibility, and multi-location management, allowing pharmacy teams to stay organized while maintaining consistent, connected care across all locations. By centralizing workflows and conversations, Pill Connect reduces fragmentation and helps pharmacies operate more efficiently while improving patient engagement.

Impact & Takeaways
Pill Connect demonstrates how centralizing communication and operational workflows can significantly reduce friction in pharmacy operations. By bringing patients, pharmacies, and healthcare providers onto a single platform, the system improves coordination, minimizes missed messages, and creates a more consistent experience across multiple locations.

This project highlights my ability to identify real-world inefficiencies, design scalable systems, and build product solutions that balance usability with operational complexity. Pill Connect reflects a product-first mindset—focused not just on features, but on delivering meaningful improvements to how healthcare teams stay connected and serve patients.
